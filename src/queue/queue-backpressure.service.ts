/**
 * #issue3 — Backpressure + starvation prevention for the priority queue tiers.
 *
 * All background jobs share the same worker resources, split across the
 * critical / normal / low-priority Bull queues (see `PriorityQueueService`).
 * That routing alone isn't enough under sustained load: without an explicit
 * backpressure check, callers can keep enqueueing low-priority work that
 * piles up behind critical jobs, and without an aging mechanism a
 * continuous stream of high-priority jobs can starve low-priority jobs
 * forever.
 *
 * This service adds the two missing pieces:
 *  1. `shouldDeferLowPriority()` — a cheap pressure check callers can use
 *     before enqueueing non-critical work, so it can be deferred/dropped
 *     when critical + normal queues are backed up during a traffic spike.
 *  2. `promoteStarvedJobs()` — a periodic sweep that re-queues low-priority
 *     jobs that have waited longer than `starvationAgeMs` into the shared
 *     priority queue at HIGH priority, guaranteeing forward progress.
